You know the kind of feeling
It hurts and there is no pain
Time is crawling slowly
Pumping through my brain

You know the kind of feeling
Neither bore nor will
Time is almost freezing
Time is standing still

I wanna see you one more time
Time for a fool
I wanna see you one more night
Night to be cruel

I'm rather scared to see you
Even one more time
I know it's time for leaving
Cos' I'm afraid of love

You know the kind of feeling
You're not getting what you want
Time to be running
I don't know where to go

I wanna see you one more time
Time for a fool
I wanna see you one more night
Night to be cruel

I wanna see you one more time
Time for a fool
I wanna see you one more night
Night to be cruel

You know the kind of feeling
It hurts and there is no pain
Time is crawling slowly
Pumping through my brain

You know the kind of feeling
Neither bore nor will
Time is almost freezing
Time is standing still

I wanna see you one more time
Time for a fool
I wanna see you one more night
Night to be cruel

I wanna see you one more time
Time for a fool
I wanna see you one more night
Night to be cruel

I'm rather scared to see you
Even one more time
I know it's time for leaving
Cos' I'm afraid of love

You know the kind of feeling
You're not getting what you want
Time to be running
I don't know where to go

I wanna see you one more time
Time for a fool
I wanna see you one more night
Night to be cruel
