Blucine la lucine la doule
His visions are making me stay
The artist pretending it's art
The question is where do you pay
I'll pack my case one more time
I'll cancel my train once again
Destiny give me a day
The watching is frozen again

Blucine la lucine la doule
His visions are making me stay
The artist pretending it's art
The question is where do you
Do you pay la lucine.
