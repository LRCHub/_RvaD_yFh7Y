# NOISEMAKER – FREEZE

```
When I think I'm getting close
Suddenly I'm caught
in the freeze
When I fight against the cold
I'm losing by 1000 degrees
I can not do this on my own
I've fallen to my knees
Far from home
I was never even close
No I wasn't even close
Suddenly I'm caught
in the freeze
I started strongest
but I finished last
My heart was honest
but she threw it all away
And every time I don't give up
It gets a little worse,
each day,
oh no
And now the blizzard is
about to crash
When I think I'm getting close
Suddenly I'm caught
in the freeze
When I fight against the cold
I'm losing by 1000 degrees
I can not do this on my own
I've fallen to my knees
Far from home
I was never even close
No I wasn't even close
Suddenly I'm caught
in the freeze
To stand just means
I'll never stand a chance
My heart will freeze
before the storm will pass away
Somebody saying "just give up
And you won't have to feel
no pain, let go"
But all I really know is I cant,
no no,
And when I think
I'm getting close
Suddenly a break in the trees
And I see what I need most
To kindle one more fire in me
Maybe I'm closer then I know
I'm crawling on my knees
With my last hope
Cause I know I'm getting close
Cause I know I'm getting close
Close enough for me to believe
Close enough for me to believe
Maybe I'm closer then I know
I'm crawling on my knees
With my last hope
Cause I know I'm getting close
Cause I know I'm getting close
Close enough for me to believe
